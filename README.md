# gnarf

## What is it?

Gnarf is a chrome extension which displays if you have unread GitHub notifications,
and allows you to go to the first one, in order to visit them all without having
to go back to the GitHub Notifications home every time.

## Why gnarf?

Because naming is hard.

## Installation

You can install the extension like any other one.  
Once this is done, go to create a new token at this address: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Visit the page's options and set the token there.
